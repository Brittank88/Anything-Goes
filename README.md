## Anything Goes

---

### What is this?
This is a server-side (AKA vanilla-client-compatible) mod aiming to:
- Remove any and all restrictions on enchantments (both in terms of max levels and what they can be applied to).
- Fix bugs or crashes relating to over-levelled enchantments.
- Add alternative behaviours and synergies between enchantments as well as what they are applied to.
- Provide QOL changes for enchantments whose functionality I don't agree with (lol).
- Make all of the above configurable.

### Will you support version `X`?
I'd much prefer to stick to `1.19.X+`, however after reaching a stable point in `1.19.X`, I am willing to consider backports as far as `1.18.X`.

### Will you add feature `X`?
If it seems like it would fit, and does not break the ability for vanilla clients to connect to a server running the mod, then feel free to add suggestions via the issue tracker!
